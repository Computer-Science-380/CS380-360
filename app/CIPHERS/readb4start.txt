This is an interface , 
Since python does not have a way of doing interface like java 
we are going to use an abstract class, for us all to know which types of methods
we are going to use. 

Please study what abstract classes are if you do not know, but in resume it only means that 
the methods in the cipher_SuperClass , have to be implemented in the childs, meaning all the 
ciphers. 
This is meant for organization purposes.

Also I will be reading comments or things that need to be addresses here ,
If you have any comments you can tag @trujillonefi12 like This
